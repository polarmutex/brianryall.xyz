I like to define a yearly theme for each year. To start the year, I joined Mastodon and came across [Ken on Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/@kev). Ken had a challenge to write 100 posts in a year's time.  For 2021, my theme is creating. I have spent too much time processing and consuming others content than I have lost the skills I need to create. This year I am going to participate in the [100 days to offload challenge](https://100daystooffload.com/). In this year I want to create 100 posts on what I find interesting, problems I solved, and things I am working on.

Reading and watching others contest always gives me thoughts and opinions and sometimes even see connections to other things I consumed. I also need to be able to write my thoughts and opinions clearly and the process of keep writing will help me to always be improving. I look forward to sharing my journey on this site as I continue to grow and improve. You can follow along my journey by subscribing to my RSS feed on the link above.
